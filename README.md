I DO NOT ENDORSE ANY MISUSE OF THIS REPOSITORY AND THE CODE IN IT

Some borring ransomware i have written because writing malware is fun, no intentions to use it myself.

If you were to get hit by ransomware and you can recgonise it as this software, the decryption software is provided in the releases (working on that)

if you would like to commit, go ahead just dont be an asshole
